<<<--THINGS TO REMEMBER-->>>

• If you want to scrape data from large websites like facebook and twitter it would be helpful, if you
first investigate on whether they have a public API, because big comapanies provide developers with public
API to serve up data in a more effecient way.

• Websites know if you are requesting data from their sites and they might not like it if you are doing it 
manually, so better check for their API's first.

• Manually scraping data is effective and reliable to small or medium size websites.

• Requesting data from a website too excessively might slow the website, so be aware.

• Some websites block requests if you hammer them frequently.
